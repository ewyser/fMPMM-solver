ADD REFERENCE

### Distributed software, directory content:

case1_elastic_loading | numerical investigation of the compression of an elastic column to reproduce the results from the manuscript

case2_cantilever_beam | numerical investigation of the cantilever beam problem to reproduce the results from the manuscript

case3_elastoplastic_slump| numerical investigation of the elastoplastic slump problem to reproduce the results from the manuscript

### QUICK START:

Open Matlab, select the example routines, run the script and post-process results with the postprocessing.m routine

### COMPATIBILITY:

fMPMM-solver was designed under a MATLAB architecture. However, it can also be run with OCTAVE. We did not check the compatibility of the solver with every version of MATLAB nor OCTAVE, but we provide a non-exhaustive list of compatibility

MATLAB version: R2018b, R2018a, R2017b, R2016a, R2013b

OCTAVE version: 5.1.0.0
